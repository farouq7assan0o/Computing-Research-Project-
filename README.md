# Enhancing Big Data Security through 3DES Implementation at ATG

## **Project Overview**

This research investigates the readiness of ATG to implement the Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES) as a means of enhancing big data security during transmission, processing, and storage. The project combines literature analysis, survey-based data collection, and statistical evaluation to assess workforce preparedness, technological infrastructure, and strategic alignment.

## **Research Purpose**

To assess ATG’s capability to adopt 3DES encryption technology and enhance security practices across its data lifecycle, ensuring minimal risk of data breaches and alignment with organizational goals.

## **Research Objectives**

- Evaluate the workforce's skill set and familiarity with encryption technologies, particularly 3DES.
- Assess the alignment of 3DES implementation with ATG's strategic vision.
- Identify technical and operational challenges expected during the transition.
- Provide actionable recommendations based on data-driven insights.

## **Research Questions**

1. How prepared is ATG's workforce in terms of knowledge and skills to adopt 3DES for big data security?
2. How does 3DES implementation align with ATG's strategic goals?
3. What are the expected operational impacts and infrastructure readiness for this transition?

## **Methodology**

**Approach:** Mixed-methods with a focus on quantitative surveys  
**Philosophy:** Interpretivism with a deductive case study design  
**Tools:** Google Forms, Excel (for data visualization and analysis)

### **Data Collection**

- Quantitative survey distributed to ATG employees
- Collected data on demographics, technical knowledge, training needs, and strategic perspectives

### **Data Analysis**

- Statistical analysis using descriptive measures (percentages, charts)
- Thematic insights extracted from patterns in workforce feedback
- Comparative alignment with findings from literature review

## **Ethical Considerations**

- Approved by HTU research ethics committee
- Informed consent was collected through participant briefing
- All responses were anonymized and securely stored
- Research data will be deleted after project completion per ethical guidelines

## **Key Findings**

- 66% of respondents rated themselves confident in adapting to new encryption technologies
- Majority saw 3DES implementation aligning well with ATG’s strategic goals
- 60% had prior experience with similar technologies, indicating foundational readiness
- Need identified for hybrid training formats (online, workshops, hands-on)
- Technical infrastructure is moderately ready, but upgrades are advised

## **Recommendations**

1. Develop tailored training programs at beginner and advanced levels
2. Conduct full infrastructure assessment for compatibility with 3DES
3. Set up internal mentorship using experienced staff as peer trainers
4. Integrate risk management to mitigate performance or compatibility issues
5. Communicate strategic benefits of 3DES to enhance organizational buy-in

## **Reflection**

From this project, I learned the importance of being flexible in choosing methodologies and improving statistical and qualitative research skills. If I were to redo this study, I would combine surveys with focus groups for richer insights and expand tool use beyond Excel to SPSS or R.

## **Action Plan for Future Projects**

- Clearly define mixed-method designs from the start
- Include strategic stakeholder interviews early
- Invest time in survey design to avoid knowledge assumption biases
- Use layered data analysis tools for both breadth and depth
- Build feedback loops for adaptive methodology during data collection

## **Tools and Resources**

- Google Forms (survey and data collection)
- Excel (quantitative analysis and visualization)
- ResearchGate, IEEE, ScienceDirect (literature sources)
